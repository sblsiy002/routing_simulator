Inter-domain Routing Simulator

This project will develop an inter-domain simulator for the African Internet, useful for exploring various routing/peering scenarios and interconnection policies. The simulator will allow experimentation on inter-network configurations, such as the  insertion and/or removal of links and IXPs, the implementation of different routing policies, and the introduction of content cache servers. In turn, the simulator will generate performance data related to changes in a set of key metrics (e.g. delay and throughput) from the perspective of different stakeholders, including end-users, network operators and regulators
